## sentry-hosted

* [Self-Hosted Sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/issues/1153)
* [`./install.sh` error](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/issues/1242)

### Step

```shell
git clone git@github.com:getsentry/self-hosted.git
cd self-hosted
brew install coreutils
bash install.sh
```

* `sh` vs `bash` ?
